## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Jellyfin Server** (v10.8 or higher)
- A music library configured in your Jellyfin server
- **Discord** (optional, for Rich Presence integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nessli420/jellify.git
   cd jellify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
#### Portable Executable (Recommended)

Create a single, standalone portable executable that can run from anywhere:

```bash
npx electron-builder --win portable
```
This will generate a portable executable: **`dist/Jellify 1.0.0.exe`**

**Benefits:**
- **Single file** - No installation required, runs from anywhere
- **No dependencies** - All files self-extract to a temporary location at runtime
- **~78 MB** - Complete app bundled in one executable
- **Custom icon** - Automatically embeds `icon.ico` from the project root

#### Development Build

For testing, create an unpacked directory build:

```bash
npm run package
```

This generates a folder-based build in `dist/Jellify-win32-x64/` with all files visible. The `Jellify.exe` in this folder **requires all supporting files** (like `icudtl.dat`, `locales/`, `resources/`) to be in the same directory.

#### Custom Icon

To use your own icon:

1. Create or convert an icon to `.ico` format (recommended sizes: 16x16 to 256x256)
2. Save it as `icon.ico` in the project root
3. Run the build command - the icon will automatically be embedded
